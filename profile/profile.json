It was implemented using openCV to find empty rectangular spaces on the parking image for the CNN where we built on top of VGG16 with some hyper-parameters and atained a test loss of about 0.17",

      "description": "I developed cross-platform compatible solutions for an e-commerce site and app using React Native and Flutter. By implementing lazy loading techniques and optimizing images with Webpack, I improved the website's response time by 20%. My role involved debugging and resolving issues in JS, HTML, and C++ with the help of React Testing Library and Cypress, ensuring efficient bug detection and resolution. I facilitated seamless communication in both French and English through platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams, while conducting thorough code reviews and testing on a donor-facing web app to maintain high code quality and enhance user experience. My database management expertise with MySQL and PostgreSQL allowed me to implement indexing and query optimization techniques. I played a key role in enhancing UI/UX through Figma for design and prototyping, collaborating using InVision for feedback and iteration. Additionally, I managed Shopify-based websites, handling customization, theme development, and technical issues. I maintained and optimized the e-commerce app with Chart.js for data visualization, identifying key product trends. I also implemented new app functions using AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB, and deployed applications on Amazon EC2, contributing to a 10% increase in revenue. Finally, I integrated GraphQL for efficient API communication and set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.",
